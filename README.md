# Film-Popularity-and-Performance-Analysis
Welcome to my second project on databases. This project also focuses on pulling information from the Sakila database using MySQL.
In this portfolio, the information to be retrieved is about the Movie Popularity and Performance Analysis with the aim of knowing the following:
1. Identifying the movies that generated the highest and lowest revenue.
2. Comparing the number of rentals of each movie with the revenue generated.
3. Analyzing whether or not movies with certain ratings or in certain categories are rented more often.
